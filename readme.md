## How to Add a New Camera to the Map?

If you want to add a new camera to the allsky.fi site map, create a new issue according to the JSON code below.

```json
    {
        "location": "Camera City",
        "latitude": "Camera Location",
        "longitude": "Camera Location",
        "imageUrl": "Camera jpg url",
        "cameraUrl": "Camera public site",
        "author": "Camera Owner",
        "authorUrl": "Author homepage"
    }
```

If your code is incomplete, it will not be published.
